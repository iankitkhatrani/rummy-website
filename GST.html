        <h1>RummyLegit GST Policy on Cash Deposits</h1>
        <h1>Effective Date: 1st October 2023</h1>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            At RummyLegit, we strive to ensure transparency and compliance with all government regulations regarding
            online gaming. In accordance with the latest government mandate, a Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 28% is
            applicable on each add cash transaction towards online money gaming. This tax is levied by the government,
            and RummyLegit has no role in the determination or alteration of this tax rate.

        <h1>GST Calculation and Wallet Credits:</h1>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            When you add cash to your RummyLegit account, the 28% GST will be calculated as part of your deposited
            amount. Here’s how it works using a ₹500 deposit as an example:

            <br>
            <br>
            - Total Deposit: ₹500 (This is the amount you choose to add to your RummyLegit account).
            <br>
            - GST Calculation (28%):The effective contribution towards gameplay, after excluding GST, is calculated by
            dividing the deposit by 1.28. For a ₹500 deposit, this calculation is ₹500 / 1.28 = ₹390.625.
            <br>
            - GST Amount: The GST amount is the difference between your total deposit and the effective contribution
            towards gameplay. From the ₹500 deposit, the GST would be ₹500 - ₹390.625 = ₹109.375.
            <br>
            To ensure clarity and fairness, the GST amount will be reflected in your bonus wallet, while the remaining
            amount, in this example, ₹390.625, will be credited to your cash wallet.
            <br>
            - <b>Bonus Wallet (GST Amount):</b> ₹109.375
            - <b>Cash Wallet:</b> ₹390.625


        </div>
        <h1>Total Wallet Reflection:
        </h1>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            Despite the division between your cash wallet and bonus wallet, your main account balance will still reflect
            the total amount deposited, ₹500, inclusive of GST. This approach ensures that the total value of your
            deposit remains accessible for gameplay, in line with our commitment to provide a transparent and
            user-friendly gaming experience.
