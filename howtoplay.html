            need to make minimum 2 sequences, out of which one needs to be pure sequence and rest can be any valid

        </div>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            Pure - A pure sequence is a group of three or more cards of the same suit, placed in consecutive order. To
            form a pure sequence in rummy card game, a player cannot use any Joker or wild card.
        </div>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            Sequence - An impure sequence is a group of three or more cards of the same suit with one or more Joker card
            used.
        </div>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            Set - A set is a group of three or more cards of the same value but of different suits. When you are forming
            sets, you can use wild card and Jokers.
        </div>

        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            The set is formed with same card of different suits, However, you can’t use two or more cards of the same
            suit.
        </div>
        <h1>This is Invalid Declaration</h1>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            Also, note that a set can have more than 4 cards.
            If you have a set of 4 cards and add additional Joker, then in total it becomes a 5-card group and still be
            valid set.
        </div>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            At no given time a hand can have more than 13 cards.
        </div>

            cards are not in valid sequences and sets. Therefore, the player will lose the game and the competitor will
            automatically be declared as the winner.

        <h1>Common Terms Used in Rummy Rules</h1>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            Here are some common terms of Indian Rummy that every player needs to know before he starts playing.
        </div>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            Rummy Table - It is the table where the game of rummy is played. Every rummy table can sit two to six
            players for each game.
        </div>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            What is Joker and Wild Cards? - In each rummy deck there is a Printed Joker and there is a Wild Card that is
            selected at random at the beginning of the game. The role of both these types of cards is the same. Jokers
            are used to form sets and impure sequences. A Joker card can replace the desired number when forming the
            groups. This is a valid formation in a rummy game.
        </div>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            What is Draw and Discard? - In all Rummy games, each player is dealt 13 cards. Additionally, there are 2
            stacks from which each player can select cards, thereby drawing a card. Once a player draws a card, he must
            get rid of one card - this is called discarding.
        </div>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            What is Sorting of Cards? - Sorting of cards are done at the beginning of the game. This is done to arrange
            your cards to help you form your sets and sequences reducing the probability of mixing the cards. Once, the
            cards are displayed, you can hit the Sort button and start playing.
        </div>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            What is a Drop? - When a player decides to leave the game table at the start or middle of the rummy game, it
            is a drop. The act is withdrawing from the game as a personal decision. The first drop=20 points; middle
            drop= 40 points and last drop and maximum point loss is 80 points.
        </div>

        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            In case of Pool rummy, if a player drops in 101 pool, the score is 20. In case, it is 201 pool rummy, the
            drop score is 25.
        </div>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            In a Deals game, where it is best of 2 and best of 3, then a drop is not allowed.
        </div>

        <h1>How Are Winnings Calculated in Rummy?</h1>
        <h1>Winning Calculation in Points Rummy?</h1>

        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            When you are playing points rummy cash games, it is based on a predecided rupee value. The winner of the
            game wins the entire cash amount lost by the other players at the end of the game.
        </div>
        <h1>Here is how the calculation is done.</h1>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            Winning Cash = (Sum of all points of opponents) X (Rupee value of the point) - Rummy Game Fee
        </div>

        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            Example: Players pay the fixed entry fee for the tournament, which is used to form the prize pool. If 5
            players join a pool rummy with Rs. 50 as entry fee. The prize pool of the game will be Rs. 250.
            <br></br>
            The winner will win Rs. 50 x 5 = Rs. 250
            <br>
            This amount will be credited to the winner’s account after the deduction of the Rummy fees.
        </div>
        <h1>Winning Calculation in Deals Rummy?</h1>
        <div class="privacy_container_top">
            In deals rummy, the winner wins all the chips at the end of each deal. Here is how the winnings are
            calculated:
            <br>
            Winnings =Sum of points of all opponents assuming each chip is equal to one point.
            <br>
            Example: Let’s assume that there are 6 players on the table and the player 5 declares his hand. The other
            four players will lose with 10, 20, 30, 35 and 40 points respectively. The winner’s chips will be calculated
            as 10 + 20 + 30 + 35 + 40 =135 chips.
